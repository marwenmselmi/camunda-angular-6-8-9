# Angular BPMN Sample project : Angular 6/8/9 + Camunda



This is a simple project demonstrating how to integrate Angular (6) with the BPMN-JS components. It is the 
some rewrite of the project integrating Angular2 with BPMN-JS: https://github.com/narve/ang2-bpmnjs 

NB: This project is not affiliated with / created by / endorsed by (etc) Camunda/BPMN.IO or anybody but myself. 


To run this project: 
 
    git clone git@github.com:abryukhov/angular-bpmn-io.git
    cd angular-bpmn-io
    npm install
    ng serve 
    
Then look at http://localhost:4200


# Features / Status

- Angular CLI based project
- No installation / setup required, besides `node`/`npm`
- Tested on Linux and Windows (plain Powershell, not Git Bash)

- Async loading of a sample BPMN diagram
- Properties panel

- Surprisingly little actual code (including configuration files!)
- Hopefully usable as a template / inspiration for actual production use
- Hopefully as future-proof as any front-end code can be these days
